## Climate Analysis and Exploration

Prior to planning my trip to boogie, SUP, and rip in Hawaii for a while, I utilized Python and SQLAlchemy to do some gnarly climate analysis and data exploration using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

### Precipitation Analysis

Using the data, I grabbed 12 months of precipitation data and loaded it into a wicked dataframe to plot.

### Station Analysis

Without wiping out, I checked out which station in Hawaii was the most active.  I made another rad dataframe and histogram showing the temperature observed over 12 months at this rockin' station.

## Climate App

Switching over to goofy-foot, I designed a Flask API based on the queries developed.

## Bonus 1 & 2

After munching on some Loco Moco and Shave Ice, I recharged and paddled through a little chop into the Bonus portions.  I completed Bonus 1 and the majority of Bonus 2 for some extra points in the surf competition.  But then dinged a skeg and had to paddle back in to call it a day rather than be a buoy.

Mahalo, Heather
